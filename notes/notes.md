Solo Leveling will be the default theme
and themes will not change the ui of ligin and sign up page...



the main goal is to make the user stay on the app for a long time and have it like a game!
like when user completes a workout, or a mission/quest, have longer streaks he will get coins
i will tell you later what to do with the coins...


if user opens in for the first time, he will have a option to either login or sign up

sign up will ask:
username (unique)
email (unique)
password
confirm password
age
gender
height
weight

then data will be stored
but in addition in that users data we need to store the following data:
joined date
lastlogin for tracking streak ig
theme
coins set to 0 at start

prgression (this will have) [
level set to 1 at start
xp set to 0 at start
streak set to 0 at start
]

workouts[
    bassed on what the user choose or adds later
]

skills [ 
strength set to 1 at start
agility set to 1 at start
endurance set to 1 at start
]

badges []
friends []
bio
cardsOwned (this is a feuture that will be added later, its the usage of coins...)


and more if u think something is needed



in login it will just be
elaim or username
and password


and then take directly to dashboard
(if the user has already logged in once it will always bring him to this page(dashboard) when he opens te app)
