1. Data Organization & Denormalization
1.1. Storing Ranking Data
Your current Firebase structure stores user data under a unique key (e.g., UcmYDmy1HWRUCKzYBwJH5jtgPXM2) and contains a nested object such as progression which includes totalXP. For ranking users, you’ll mainly work with this field. However, to improve query efficiency and reduce data transfer:

Duplicate Key Fields:
Consider storing the user’s total XP directly on the root of their document or in a dedicated leaderboard node. This avoids deep nesting when querying (e.g., a top-level field totalXP).

Additional Categorization Fields:
To support Continental, Country, and Regional leaderboards, store additional metadata such as continent, country, and region (or state/area). These fields can be added at the time of user registration (or updated periodically based on location data). This is critical because:

Query Efficiency: Firebase queries become more efficient when you can directly filter by fields.

Indexing: You can create composite indexes (or simple ones) for these fields combined with totalXP.

Time-Scoped Leaderboards:
For Monthly, Weekly, and Daily rankings, you might want to precompute the XP earned within that period.

For example, add fields like dailyXP_total, weeklyXP_total, monthlyXP_total that are updated either in real time (if the update rate is low) or via scheduled Cloud Functions (if you need to aggregate many records).



2. Ranking Calculation Methodology
2.1. Global & Overall Ranking
Global Leaderboard (Overall):
A simple query that orders all user documents by totalXP (or your designated overall score) in descending order, with a limit to the top 100.

2.2. Time-Scoped Leaderboards
Monthly, Weekly, and Daily:
Each of these leaderboard types requires a different numeric value:

Overall: Uses totalXP.

Monthly: Uses monthlyXP_total (or aggregate the values from the dailyXP map for the current month).

Weekly/Daily: Similar approach using weeklyXP_total or the specific day’s XP.
You can manage these via:

Real-time Updates: If the dataset is small, update these values on each XP transaction.

Scheduled Cloud Functions: For larger datasets, a background function can aggregate the daily values periodically to update the monthly/weekly scores.

2.3. Geographic & Social Filters
Continental / Country / Regional Ranking:
Once you have the additional fields (continent, country, and region):

Query: Use Firebase queries to filter out users based on these fields, then order by totalXP (or the relevant time-scoped XP).

User’s Perspective: When a user opens the leaderboard, show their own ranking by querying for their country or region. You can additionally compute the user’s rank by comparing their score with that of others (this is sometimes done via counting documents above the user’s score, which might need a Cloud Function if the dataset is large).

Followers Ranking:

Strategy: Use the user's following array to get a list of followed user IDs.

Query: Perform a multi-get query (or several individual queries) to fetch data for each followed user, then sort this list client-side by totalXP.



3. Maintaining Ranking Accuracy
3.1. Real-Time Updates and Cloud Functions
Real-Time Listener:
Enable real-time listeners on the leaderboard node if you wish the leaderboard to update live. However, be cautious: reading many documents and updating frequently can have performance impacts on Firebase’s real-time database.

Cloud Functions for Aggregation:
Due to write frequency or batch updates:

Use Cloud Functions to trigger on changes (e.g., when a user's totalXP changes), update the leaderboard nodes or recalculate aggregates for monthly, weekly, and daily scores.

Ensure your leaderboard collections are structured to allow efficient queries (for example, one node per leaderboard type).

3.2. Handling Concurrent Writes
Transactions and Atomic Updates:
When multiple users are updating their XP simultaneously:

Use Firebase transactions to ensure that score updates are atomic. This prevents race conditions that might lead to inaccurate ordering.

Caching/Indexing:
Maintain cache layers (if necessary, using Firebase’s provided mechanisms or an external service like Redis) that can quickly compute rank positions without heavy database load.




4. Practical Implementation Steps
Database Schema Adjustment:

Update your Firebase structure to store totalXP at the top level and add continent, country, and region fields.

Optionally, create aggregate fields for daily, weekly, and monthly XP.

Querying and Indexing:

For each leaderboard, create queries that sort by the relevant XP field and filter using additional parameters (e.g., country == 'yourCountry').

Ensure Firebase indexing rules are set up accordingly to facilitate efficient queries.

Cloud Functions Deployment:

Write Cloud Functions that update aggregate scores when a user’s XP changes.

Set up triggers for geographical information updates if necessary.

UI Integration:

Design your leaderboard pages with the layout specifications.

Implement real-time listeners if live updates are needed (or schedule periodic refreshes).

Integrate follow/unfollow functionality tied to the user’s authentication state and document updates.

Testing:

Test for correctness of rankings across all filters.

Simulate concurrent updates to ensure transactions are handling consistency correctly.
