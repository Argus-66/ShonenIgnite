ANTI CHEAT
🚨 Why people cheat:
Flex on leaderboards.
Brag to friends.
Unlock stuff faster (levels, coins, achievements).


🧠 Anti-Cheat Strategies:
1️⃣ Limit Max XP per Day
No matter what crazy goals they set, cap the XP. Example:

Max XP/day = 500
So even if they log 10 workouts, the max they get is 500 XP that day


2️⃣ Goal Size Limits
Put logic like:

Max 100 reps per exercise daily.
Max 3 hours logged per day.
Reject unrealistically high inputs (e.g., “2000 pushups”).


3️⃣ Cooldowns
Prevent spamming:
Can only complete the same workout once every X hours.


5️⃣ Achievements Not Just XP
Make leaderboards show more than XP.

Longest streaks.
Hardest workouts.
Real "verified" achievements.


6️⃣ Skill XP Separation
Make it so high goals aren’t always better. For example:

You gain better XP if you vary workouts.
Repeating "100 squats" every day gives diminishing returns.
